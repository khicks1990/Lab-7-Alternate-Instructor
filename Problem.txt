Chapter 8 presented an Instructor class that holds information about an instructor. (See Section 8.7) Modify the Instructor class by overriding the HashCode and equals methods. Then write a class that stores several Instructors objects in a HashSet. The class should be able to display all the instructors in the set, and allow the user to search for an instructor. Demonstrate the class in an application.
